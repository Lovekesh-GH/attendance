</span>

<span style="color:#fff; font-family: 'Bebas Neue'; font-size: 1.1em;">Attendance Management Systems </span> allow you to calculate the hours for which employees work accurately. This is especially beneficial if you have employees working on an hourly basis. You need to be able to calculate the exact wages you owe to your employees. And, you need to know if you owe overtime wages to any employees.Attendance management also lets you keep track of how many **days off** employees use.

</span>

This is a real time **face recognition** system in which the software recognizes the registered person.First of all, the employees
must get themselves enlisted in the system and then during the time of attendance, a frame will display their picture with the audio of **registered successfully**.The record of each employee will be stored in the file where it will keep all the information about their arrival so that the organisation will be able to calculate the exact wages they owe to their employees.
